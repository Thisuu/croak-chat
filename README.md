"**Croak Chat**" is an AI companion app; built around the famous [CROAK](https://croakonlinea.eth.limo/) and [eFrogs](https://efrogs.eth.limo/) culture on Linea, 
And is based on _GROK_ by [xAI](https://x.ai/) rather than OpenAI.
Croak is designed to be _Helpful_ and yet _Sarcastic, Playful an Humorous_; adapted to the croak-culture.
<br/>A background sound and message Receive/Send tones have been added for a more fun experience. CROAK! üê∏<br/>

You can chat freely with Croak and bring your chats onchain by minting it as an NFT on Linea.
<br/>[CA](https://lineascan.build/token/0xd6cd177439fb5896785855d7bce5445287e151f4) on Linea Mainnet: ``0xD6Cd177439fB5896785855D7Bce5445287E151F4``<br/><br/>

Also, Croak Chat's main page has been designed with a beautiful soothing experience, which, you may also use as your relaxation music at the end of the day. A Plus! You will love it! üé∂
<br/>If the background music is not played upon your first visit to the app (A browser limitation), Please login and then return to the Main Page through the _Frog_ icon on top-left. I've avoided adding any buttons to keep the distraction to a minimum.<br/>

Future plans include:
1) Importing previous chats minted onchain
2) Token gated access for more AI personas
3) A community chat..

<br/>Enjoy!
